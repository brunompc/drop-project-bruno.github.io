Assignments are created by teachers and Submissions are created by students, according to the assignment instructions. The students' goal is to pass all the tests.<\/p>\n<p>Assignments<\/p>\n<p>The interesting thing is that assignments are just regular maven projects (in Java or Kotlin), stored in a regular git repository - there's nothing specific to DP in them.<\/p>\n<p>Users with the TEACHER role will be able to create an assignment by connecting DP with its repository and filling some information. You can see an example in https://github.com/palves-ulht/sampleJavaAssignment<\/p>\n<p>The good thing is that you can code and test the assignments in your IDE, without using DP. After you finished, just connect DP to your repository. If you make further changes, just refresh the assignment in DP.<\/p>\n<p>Submissions<\/p>\n<p>After the assignment is marked active, students will be able to submit their projects, trying to pass all the assignment junit tests. They can submit their project by dropping a zip file or by connecting DP to a git repository containing their submission (this is specified by the teacher when she creates the assignment).<\/p>\n<p>Students can submit alone or in group - they just have to include an AUTHORS.txt in their project. One of the things that students like in DP is the fact that they can submit multiple times until they pass all the tests. It's up to the teacher to determine if the number of submissions has an effect in the final grade.<\/p>\n<p>The structure is the standard structure for standalone Java/Kotlin projects:<\/p>\n"

The easiest way to do this is to clone one of the the following repositories:<\/p>\n<p>https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleJavaAssignment<\/p>\n<p>https://github.com/drop-project-edu/sampleKotlinAssignment<\/p>\n<p>Structure<\/p>\n<p>The structure of the repository must be the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>assignment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<aside>\n<p>--- pom.xml  (includes the checkstyle and junit plugins)\n--- checkstyle.xml  (the rules to validate the code style, e.g., variables must start with lowercase)\n--- instructions.html     (optional, the assignment instructions)\n--- src\n------ main\n--------- ... (here goes the reference implementation, in maven structure)\n------ test\n--------- ... (junit tests that will validate students' submissions)<\/p>\n<\/aside>\n<p>After the creation of the repository, the following steps should be followed in the Drop Project web-application:<\/p>\n<p>Login with your teacher account\nFrom the top menu, open the �Manage Assignments� page\nPress the �Create Assignment� blue button that appears in the bottom of the page\nFill in the form - below each field there is a short description of its purpose<\/p>\n<p>How to create tests<\/p>\n<p>Public tests should be defined in a file whose name should start with �TestTeacher�. For example, �TestTeacherPerson�.<\/p>\n<p>Hidden tests should be defined in a file whose name should start with �TestTeacherHidden�. For example, �TestTeacherHiddenPerson�.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible to have multiple test public and hidden test classes.<\/p>\n"
